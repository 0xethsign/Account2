# Account2
## Account Abstraction & Economic Abstraction for Ethereum

### Overview
`Account2` is a contract designed to accomplish three key features not yet enshrined in the Ethereum protocol.

`Account Abstraction` the ability to have an account that will allow a relayer to act on behalf of the account owner as `msg.sender`. This will solve three major UX challenges experienced in the first allowing all transactions to be bundled in a single transaction (i.e.: the necessity for an approve transaction before a swap transaction). Next it will allow a relayer to sponsor the gas for a transaction which is a major UX hurdle for Ethereum adoption. Lastly, a controlling key that has been compromised can be replaced in a single transaction transfering all the asset held in the `Account2` account.

`Economic Abstraction` the ability to pay an Ethereum transaction gas fee in any ERC20 token. Economic abstraction allows the user to pay for transaction in any ERC20 they hold in their `Account2`.

`Account Linking` the ability to associate accounts heirachically with a single private key. Since the `owner` of an account can be a contract we set the owner to a root `Account2` and all requests will begin in the root `Account2` and will be forwarded to subordinate `Account2` accounts. Using singly linked design we can establish any level of heirarchy with minimum overhead for each hop.

## Account Abstraction

As described above `Account Abstraction` using `Account2` allows the user to link multiple wallets and reassign ownership to create the desired structure.

A more complex example of how account heirarchical linking works in `Account2` can be seen in the following diagram

Using `Account2` each `Account2` can be called from the owner requiring only a single transactino from the root `Account2`. Each subsequent call is passed to the child from the `owner` where the `msg.sender` is the `owner` without the need to validate a signature. An example of the above described transaction can be seen in the following diagram.

## Economic Abstraction
`Economic Abstraction` in our design the `Account2` owner can specify the value necessary for abstracted gas payment in the signed metatransaction using the following values:

`gasToken` - an `address` for the desired ERC20 to make the transaction payment

`gasTokenRatio` - a `uint256` wad `1e18` value that represent the ratio of `gas` to `gasToken` amount. For instance if the underlying `gasToken` is $AAVE the owner wants to pay 1 $AAVE per 1 gas they would use the following formula `1/1e18` (actual ratio math should account for precision)

`gasLimit` - a `uint256` value that limits the amount of gas a relayer can spend when calling the transaction

After the completion of a transaction using the `executeAsRelayer` method in the `Account2` contract the amount of gas used for the transaction is calculated using the following formula and transfered to the `tx.origin`.
```
uint256 amountToTransfer = (gasUsed + 21000) * gasTokenRatio;
```

## Limitations of the design
Allowances and gas costs are the two main drawbacks to the current design. Allowances are instances where tokens owned by the `Account2` contract are not reset when a transfer occurs. This is only an issue in instances where the owner transfers ownership to another owner as part of a sale.

Gas costs can be reduced through golfing of the contracts but still carry some overhead. An alternative might be to enshrine `Account2` in protocol to have effectively zero gas cost to initiate a transaction.

## Getting Started

**Setup**
```bash
forge install
```

**Building**
```bash
forge build
```

**Testing**
```bash
forge test
```

**Deployment & Verification**

Inside the [`utils/`](./utils/) directory are a few preconfigured scripts that can be used to deploy and verify contracts.

Scripts take inputs from the cli, using silent mode to hide any sensitive information.

_NOTE: These scripts are required to be _executable_ meaning they must be made executable by running `chmod +x ./utils/*`._

_NOTE: these scripts will prompt you for the contract name and deployed addresses (when verifying). Also, they use the `-i` flag on `forge` to ask for your private key for deployment. This uses silent mode which keeps your private key from being printed to the console (and visible in logs)._


### First time with Forge/Foundry?

See the official Foundry installation [instructions](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/master/README.md#installation).

Then, install the [foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) toolchain installer (`foundryup`) with:
```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Now that you've installed the `foundryup` binary,
anytime you need to get the latest `forge` or `cast` binaries,
you can run `foundryup`.

So, simply execute:
```bash
foundryup
```

ðŸŽ‰ Foundry is installed! ðŸŽ‰


### Writing Tests with Foundry

With [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry), all tests are written in Solidity! ðŸ¥³

Create a test file for your contract in the `test/` directory.

For example, [`src/Greeter.sol`](./src/Greeter.sol) has its test file defined in [`./test/Greeter.t.sol`](./test/Greeter.t.sol).

To learn more about writing tests in Solidity for Foundry, reference Rari Capital's [solmate](https://github.com/Rari-Capital/solmate/tree/main/src/test) repository created by [@transmissions11](https://twitter.com/transmissions11).


### Configure Foundry

Using [foundry.toml](./foundry.toml), Foundry is easily configurable.

For a full list of configuration options, see the Foundry [configuration documentation](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/master/config/README.md#all-options).
